# Phylogenomic timetree-calibrated speciation clocks for _Caenorhabditis_ nematodes reveal slow but disproportionate accumulation of post-zygotic reproductive isolation
Supplementary data files of _Caenorhabditis_ divergence time and speciation clock calculations from Fusca et al. (2025). "_C._ sp. 24" refers to _C. agridulce_ throughout.
## Description of files
### 205 Single Copy Ortholog Alignments
Directory of DNA coding sequence alignments for the 205 groups of orthologous genes that are single-copy in all 51 species used for our primary divergence time estimates (i.e. not including _C. auriculariae_ or _C. niphades_). Each file contains one sequence for each of the 51 species. These 205 FASTA files are subdivided into four non-overlapping sets, corresponding to the four gene subsets shown in Figure 2D. Species are referred to using 5-letter abbreviations (e.g. "CELEG" for _C. elegans_).
### 692 Single Copy Orthologs Elegans Supergroup
Directory of DNA coding sequence alignments for the 692 groups of orthologous genes that are single-copy in the 31 species belonging to the Elegans supergroup clade, out of the 51 species that were used for our primary divergence time estimates (i.e. not including _C. niphades_). Each file contains one sequence for each of these 31 species. These 692 FASTA files are subdivided into four non-overlapping sets, corresponding to the four gene subsets shown in Figure 2E. Species are referred to using 5-letter abbreviations (e.g. "CELEG" for _C. elegans_).
